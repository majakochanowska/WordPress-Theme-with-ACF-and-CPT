WordPress Theme based on `_s`, or `underscores` theme, made for example landing page or home page.

I created:
* Page Template "LP Page" which uses custom header
* Sticky header with changing logo which can be set in Appearance - Customize - Site identity
* Four widgets areas in footer
* Custom post types "services" and "case studies" (using plugin Custom Post Type UI)
* Custom fields which let user easily edit content of the landing page (using plugin Advanced Custom Fields)
* Show more / show less buttons used in case studies 

The website that I made on this theme can be seen here: http://magento-lp.byethost7.com/
